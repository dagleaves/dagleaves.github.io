                        University of South Carolina students are struggling to manage their coursework  
                        that UofSC has spread across different platforms between different departments. 
                        Our solution would provide the user with a simple, one-stop location for them  
                        to be able to track and submit work for all of their classes across every department 
                        within the university.
